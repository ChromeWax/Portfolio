# Portfolio Website
A website where someone can view all my projects. 
This project uses React for the frontend side.
The website also features the ability for users to sign up for a newsletter and send an email to me.
Django is used for this feature side with multiple REST API endpoints.
Emails are stored in a PostgreSQL database.
